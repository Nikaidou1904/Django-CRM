# Onebag Database #

Discover backpacks and see if it fits in an airline's carry-on limit.


## About ##
This project is a simple website to show a list of dimensions (cm) and
weight (kg) in the tables for backpacks and carry-on limit among airlines.
It also allow users to perform CRUD operations to manipulate each record
in the tables.

The goal of the project was to eventually connect these two tables to form
a simple relational database that allow users to match the dimensions (cm)
and weight (kg) of a backpack to an airline's carry-on limit to see if it
fits. For now, it's only meant to do simple CRUD operations and present
the list.

This project caters to "One Bag" travelers hence the name. "One Bag" is 
for people who need to frequently travel on airlines but also want to 
avoid checked-in luggage at all costs. This website allows them to find a 
backpack that would suit their needs and see if it fits in an airline's 
carry-on limit.
