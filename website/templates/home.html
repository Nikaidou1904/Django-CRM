<h1>Guten tag!</h1>

<body>My name is Julius and this is my project for LIS 160. My idea was to create two tables: (1) a list of carry-on limits among different airlines in the Philippines and (2) a list of backpacks along with their weight and dimensions. The plan was to eventually let the user match the dimensions and weight of a backpack to an airline's carry-on limits but due to time constraints and skill issue on my part, I didn't add that feature to preserve my sanity. Besides, I think the requirement is that the website works flawlessly, it has CRUD, and a touch of personalization right? I got finals coming up bruh o(╥﹏╥)o</body><br/><br/>

<body>For a bit of context on the purpose of this site, there's a thing called "One Bag Travel". It's for people who frequently travel on airlines and want to avoid checked in luggage at all costs. This could mean that you could either practice minimalism by only carrying what they need or, the other end of the spectrum is consumerism which means buying ultralight gear and the most expensive backpacks on the market. I mean, most of the stuff I've seen in niche internet hobbies are consumerist but nonetheless, I still find it interesting. If you're just as curious as me and you wish to learn more about "One Bag Travel", check out the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/wiki/index/">r/onebag</a> subreddit! It contains useful information and testimonials from people who've tried it. Personally, I'm also interested in traveling around the world someday and I also discovered so many cool backpacks, which were my motivations for creating this database.
